Use this plugin for deploying a docker container application to AWS EC2 Container Service (ECS).

### Settings

* `access_key` - AWS access key ID, MUST be an IAM user with the AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess policy attached
* `secret_key` - AWS secret access key
* `user_role_arn` - AWS user role. Optional. Switch to different role after initial authentication
* `region` - AWS availability zone
* `service` - Name of the service in the cluster, **MUST** be created already in ECS
* `container_name` - Name of the container, defaults to ${family}-container
* `cluster` - Name of the cluster. Optional. Default cluster is used if not specified
* `family` - Family name of the task definition to create or update with a new revision
* `task_role_arn` - ECS task IAM role
* `docker_image`, Container image to use, do not include the tag here
* `tag` - Tag of the image to use, defaults to latest
* `port_mappings` - Port mappings from host to container, format is `hostPort containerPort`, protocol is automatically set to TransportProtocol
* `cpu`, The number of cpu units to reserve for the container
* `memory`, The hard limit (in MiB) of memory to present to the container
* `memory_reservation`, The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. Defaults to 128
* `environment_variables` - List of Environment Variables to be passed to the container, format is `NAME=VALUE`
* `deployment_configuration` - Deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the deployment and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks, format is `minimumHealthyPercent maximumPercent`
* `desired_count` - The number of instantiations of the specified task definition to place and keep running on your cluster
* `log_driver` - The log driver to use for the container
* `log_options` - The configuration options to send to the log driver
* `labels` - A key/value map of labels to add to the container
* `entry_point` - A list of strings to build the container entry point configuration
* `secret_environment_variables` - List of Environment Variables to be injected into the container from drone secrets. You can use the name of the secret itself or set a custom name to be used within the container. Syntax is `NAME` (must match the name of one of your secrets) or `CUSTOM_NAME=NAME`
* `task_cpu` - The number of CPU units used by the task. It can be expressed as an integer using CPU units, for example 1024, or as a string using vCPUs, for example 1 vCPU or 1 vcpu
* `task_memory` - The amount of memory (in MiB) used by the task.It can be expressed as an integer using MiB, for example 1024, or as a string using GB. Required if using Fargate launch type
* `task_execution_role_arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that the Amazon ECS container agent and the Docker daemon can assume.
* `compatibilities` - Space-delimited list of launch types supported by the task, defaults to EC2 if not specified
* `task_network_mode` - If compatibilities includes FARGATE, this must be set to awsvpc.
* `service_network_assign_public_ip` - Whether the task's elastic network interface receives a public IP address. The default value is DISABLED.
* `service_network_security_groups` - The security groups associated with the task or service. If you do not specify a security group, the default security group for the VPC is used. There is a limit of 5 security groups that can be specified per AwsVpcConfiguration.
* `service_network_subnets` - The subnets associated with the task or service. There is a limit of 16 subnets that can be specified per AwsVpcConfiguration.
* `ulimits` - The Ulimit property specifies the ulimit settings to pass to the container. This is an array of strings in the format: `name softLimit hardLimit` where name is one of: core, cpu, data, fsize, locks, memlock, msgqueue, nice, nofile, nproc, rss, rtprio, rttime, sigpending, stack and soft/hard limits are integers.
* `mount_points` - Mount points from host to container, format is `sourceVolume containerPath readOnly` where `sourceVolume`, `containerPath` are strings, `readOnly` is string [`true`, `false`]
* `volumes` - Bind Mount Volumes, format is `name sourcePath` both values are strings. Note with FARGATE launch type, you only provide the name of the volume, not the `sourcePath`
* `platform-version` - FARGATE launch type platform version i.e. `LATEST`, `1.4.0`, `1.3.0`...
